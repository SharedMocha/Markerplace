When is VC money needed- Because of low switching costs for its supply-side users, gig economy companies must manage margins carefully by controlling both rates and utilization so that they can attract adequate workers while also remaining a compelling proposition for customers. This is where the VC war chest comes in handy — extra cash enabled the most successful gig economy companies to weather the ups and downs of competing on margins.

Market rule to remember-
*Winner takes all. It's not who comes to market first. It's is someone who scales first.
*10% is product 90% is market and people
*Provide Convenience(Payments, Messaging, Transactions) and trust(Identity Verification, Reviews, Assurance, Your other friends from facebook booked us) are important. Trust through support when needed.
*Use Technologies like Stripe for payments, Checkr for background checks, and Lob for address verification will only make it easier to create new marketplaces.
*Frequency creates a habit which creates loyalty which creates profit.

*3 best seeding strategy to start marketplace startups:-*
1.) Single Player Mode - (BEST OF ALL) (OpenTable used this)-Create tools that add value to supply guys so they get interested in using. This is called trojan horse approach
2.) Fill Empty seats - (NO 2 BEST) (Uber, Groupon used this) -Offering to Fill Empty Seats for practitioners while telling them we will only take a % of what we were going to sell
3.) Buyers are Sellers - (NO 3 BEST) (Let go, Lyft) Create a marketplace where Buyers are Sellers using advertisements to attract initial users

*3 best expanding strategies after seeding strategies:-*
1.) Own supply-  See if we can hire practitioners and make them full time. This way we control Supply.
2.) Own entire network- See if we can control the entire experience. Like cabs to pick up people, places to have events, Sponsors to support them. We own all of them.
3.) N-sided marketplace - Bring all supplier together so they can book each other. Like hotels or place owners, Suppliers of food and drinks and practitioners. Each of them will have a profile and talk to each other and book each other (https://assets.website-files.com/5cca2e12f1988c0178a748ee/5cca2e12f1988c2907a74d2e_Market%20Network%20Companies.jpg)

4 Loyalty models-Frequency creates a habit which creates loyalty which creates profit-For low-frequency apps like Airbnb we can create loyalty using below techniques
1.) The Expedia Model (AKA SEO- Show blogs, videos of places from Expedia)
2.) The Airbnb Model (AKA Better, Cheaper- Always find places cheaper )
3.) The HotelTonight Model (AKA Insurance or Fear of not having it when needed) - Not storing contact of nearby hospital or car insurance company. We might need it very seriously at times
4.) The Houzz Model (we take advantage of an inherent human desire to stay up-to-date on things important to them)(AKA Engagement - Zillow,realtor-check ur home prices) -Come and ask questions about your health and get tips on healing that might help you or send an email monthly with nearby sessions and ask user to try one for free or create blogs that people love to read or listen to podcasts


*Steps to follow to create a winning marketplace*
```Stage 1:- Research your market, people
1.) Find who we will target first. Supply people(Practitioners)?Or Demand People(Customers)? For now, let's choose supply folks as they are important.
1.) Let's Find a place/geography where they are present along with a small niche community like healers and choose a vertical like yoga or reiki to start with.
2.) Find a place where we can get these supply people in bulk. Like, events, colleges, offices(Connect with HR and she will send email to the entire office), artificially creating profiles and asking them to claim or asking 3rd party person/companies to give us the demand profiles or whitelist_names
4.) Identify what value we will add to these supply people. As an example: Build a community for practitioners, Find a place for them to launch an event, Creating a profile or developing tools that help them run their business such as MailChimp and give it for free
5.) Figure out how to curate an experience for customers. We can create a curated experience like 5 yoga practitioners you must try and send an email or show them on the first visit.
6.) Fix on a particular marketplace model and  follow it -THIS IS V IMP -   *(Single Player Mode(Create tools for practitioners and they will come even without supply- Opentable model), Fill Empty seat model (Groupon model) , Buyers are Sellers model(Offer Up) )*

*Stage 2:- Develop an app with below features*
1.) Have a good landing Page
2.) Good onboarding experience for customers- Include trust in the process. By saying that if you didn't like we will refund your money or find a better session for you ASAP.
3.) Good boarding experience for practitioners- Include trust in this process. By saying that we cover charges if you need to cancel at the  last min or we provide a place or camera person to help you get started
3.) Create a Community(Helps with trust) for practitioners to share ideas and tips and ask questions along with finding places.
4.) Mobile-based designs
5.) Include social proof for practitioners - Ex includes your friends booked him/her(This is a growth tactic). Or showing reviews and ratings from Instagram.
6.) Include payment processing- Save card and make it one-click pay
7.) (Control demand)Curated search results(Helps with trust) with hyper-local filters that people are looking for. Mix top practitioners with recommended practitioners. Don't show based on location
8.) Messaging
9.) Personal touch - an Auto reminder for a practitioner to send a thank you note to people who came to class and asking them if they can be of any help. Also, share one or two pics of the class
10.) Customer 360- A dashboard to see classes and messages received for each class
12.) Welcome message for practitioners - This is a message that will be sent to customers who brought tickets for an event
13.) Reviews (Helps with trust-ask how practitioners what to be reviewed upon?)
14.) Social proof (Helps with trust)
33.) Reward system -to keep customers with us
34.) Follow practitioners
35.)Sending curated emails based on search. Like 5 new must-try yoga classes.
36.) Customer profile- Ask him what he likes - Yoga, Reiki etc.. (This is a growth tactic-) -send a curated list of must-try things in the area.
37.) Show verified badge next to practitioners (Helps with trust)
38.) Include assurance text in emails and communications like money back or we support you for last min changes or call us asap for issues.
39.) SEO (Check if our links are being shown for keywords people are searching)(This helps in building loyalty. As our sessions might not be booked as frequently as uber we need customers to remember us on top of their mind over a period of time)
40.) Blogs /Podcast - Same as above point. Have them linked to customer profile
41.) The practitioner should get extra useful info when creating an event like weather (what abundance of data  they need or they research before offering a session?)
42.) Customers should get extra useful info when booking-like weather, time to travel when booking (find what info is needed?)
43.) Allow the practice to add draft sessions.


*Stage 3:- Tracking what we did in stage 2 and stage 3 using reports and paying close attention to Customers using reporting or analytics-**
1.) Track Ratings - Get ratings from customers for practitioners. Remove bad actors or practitioners who have poor ratings(Less than 3)
2.) Track Community or forums - What practitioners are asking and sharing. This helps in building new Features
7.) Report on practitioners not getting a booking in the first 24 hours so we can act on them and help them.
8.) Report on 3 start ratings daily so we can act on them.
10.) Stats by location or healing. Need weekly/monthly stats on - No of practitioners available vs No of Practitioners with 1 review Vs No of Customers Joined Vs No of Customers booking--THIS IS VVIMP AS IT HELPS IN IDENTIFYING WHEN WE START SCALING. WE WILL APPLY THIS to NEW REGION OR ON PRACTISES WE START.
12.) Report on problems or emails being sent to us. Classify them based on grouping similar items and no of users requesting it and time to resolve this. If the same problem happens more than 50 times a week then we should automate it or solve it
13.) Repeat Customers report (Retention)
14.) Top performers with their classes
15.) Top days of bookings
16.) Total transaction value in number along with total money exchanged(contracted) and total profit made(delivered)
17.) Profit made per practitioners. Min 30% should be achieved
18.) Report on the number of practitioners we have while comparing to our competitors in a particular place with a practice like yoga
19.) Report on the number of session or events we have while comparing to our competitors in a particular place with a practice like yoga
20.) No of messaging we have in a month between practitioners and customers based on the type of session
21.) Calculate NPS and review counts (5,4,3,2,1 start reviews )
22.) Best acquisition channels - podcats, web,insta, word of Mouth
23.) Lifetime value - Measuring how long a customer and practitioner is with us
24.) Top days of activity
25.) Top places of activity in a state/city
26.) Practitioner to customer ratio (1 Practitioner needs min 10 customers). So if 100 practitioners we need 1000 customers to gain scale
27.) Maximum distance customer is willing to travel. Like 30 min or 5 miles for a session. This helps in marketing to people in that area
28.) No of view a session gets before it gets filled or gets one booking. This helps in getting those many sessions for events (10 views: 1  booking)
29.) How many people looking at yoga or a practice every week? how many booking is being made? This helps in removing categories where there is no business and focusing on where we have more business via ads
30.)https://versionone.vc/marketplace-kpi/
31.) User search based on location. (Ex- People from the lax area like yoga. This helps in understanding what people are looking for and handle demand)
32.) Have regular price, surge price options to manage supply-demand
33.) report on how often users book other practitioners and from which one (like yoga to reiki)
34.) How many minimum booking a customer makes before in no of days - before he is a repeat customer(frequency creates a habit which creates loyalty which creates profit)
35.) Report on no of people following practitioners
36.) transaction size vs cost (This helps us understanding transaction volume if low or high and the money we make and helps in increasing our revenue)
37.) time at which booking happen and their location
38.) Tracking irregular bookings -Like booking after 1 week or 1 month - This helps in creating better on-demand solutions for these customers or regions. As an example, if people in sfo keep booking a session every one month--then we make sure there is a practitioner available at that time.

*Stage 4 ( After solving 1,2,3):- Extending stage 3. Let's say we solve chicken and egg problem then what next for the marketplace ?* Choose one and expand more in one of the ways-
1.) Own supply-  See if we can hire practitioners and make them full time. This way we control Supply.
2.) Own entire network- See if we can control the entire experience. Like cabs to pick up people, places to have events, Sponsors to support them. We own all of them.
3.) N-sided marketplace - Bring all supplier together so they can book each other. Like hotels or place owners, Suppliers of food and drinks and practitioners. Each of them will have a profile and talk to each other and book each other (https://assets.website-files.com/5cca2e12f1988c0178a748ee/5cca2e12f1988c2907a74d2e_Market%20Network%20Companies.jpg)


*Make sure below things never ever happens-**
1.) Any request should be solved in 24 hours. Like if practitioners created an event we need to get a booking within 24 hours. For this, we need to choose one or two practitioners a day and market them heavily on google, FB, insta or verified practitioners icon or symbol on our app.
2.) No practitioners lesser than 3-star rating will be shown in search results
3.) Search results are shown based on a mix of ratings and handpicked users rather than location.
4.) Customer not books a session with first 24-72 hours. Overcome this by sending a personal email or set up a call
5.) Not having a process or playbook on how practitioners interact with customers during their visit.
6.) Not having some freebies sent to them to share with customers. This boosts our sales.
7.) Not contacting a customer who gave a 3-star rating to practitioners via email immediately and solve the issue
8.) Not having one on one meeting with top practitioners. This creates a gap as we don't know their secret mantra is. Talking to them helps us in knowing their process and replicating the same for others
9.) Not choosing a particular market or location or healing. If we can't figure out the secret sauce we can't repeat it in other markets.
10.) Not having a winning formula. For example, 100 practitioners providing 100 classes a month where 50 practitioners have reviews equals 1000 bookings. This magic equation helps us in scaling in new markets as it gives an idea on when we will achieve scale.
11.) Not being in touch with practitioners community through  local meetups
12.) Not having a customer or practitioners referral program,
13.) Not having ads or promos that say something like `Make $1000 in one weekend`
14.) Have a local team lead name, local language page to avoid competition -show that we are local
15.) Not having a pricing model- Marketplace operator or guidance can be provided to providers on what pricing is best
16.) Not having a training program for new practitioners
17.) Not tracking peak demand season. If we don't do this then we will miss the opportunity. If we track this we will have more practitioners available during this time so we can be winning
18.) Not adjusting supply and demand:- Not having surge pricing(This kicks in when the ratio of supply to demand changes or supply increases above 1x fold of -demand- ). If an area has huge demand then session prices will be higher causing the practitioner to go to that area. Now, when more practitioners come the supply matches demand and surge pricing comes down. This keeps supply and demand in place.
19.) Not decreasing prices when supply increases 2x fold in an area. Because we do surge pricing we need to compensate customers by reducing pricing when supply increases so they will benefit and practitioners as their revenue increase
19.) Not putting new folks in the busy markets as they will have empty seats.
20.) Create a barrier for customers to leave our website. Ex- rewards for sessions taken. This helps then not going elsewhere and no competition from other companies
21.) (This is  growth tactic-Airbnb used) Not targeting the place where most activity happens.. like where more people are looking for sessions or healers
36.) (This is  growth tactic-Medium did this) Not creating a curated list every week for a region
37.) Not choosing a particular practice like yoga and reiki where chicken and egg problem won't exist.
38.) Not having a list of sessions initially for users. We should work with practitioners and make sure they always have some classes that people want every time
39.) Provide subsidies for the harder side. If its harder to get customer give coupons
40.) Make sure you convey the story that our commitments are long term so practitioners and customers will stay with us
41.) Running our won classes to attract traction initially.
42.) Not controlling a marketplace. As an example, min 5 yoga practitioners per county is needed so we avoid duplicate listings
43.) Opening globally is good (Network effects) but need to take care as we should be local as we intend to grow organically and these people can lead us to new business opportunity
44.) Make practitioners as partners rather than a commodity
45.) Not having a clear distinction between similar profiles. Like 10 yoga healers doing the same, this confuses users.
46.) Not focusing more on the areas which have a higher booking.Like yoga in NYC
47.) Not asking if marketplace provide a better experience to customer “n+1000” than it did to customer “n” directly as a function of adding 1000 more participants to the market? You can pose this question to either side of the network – demand or supply. If you have something like this in place it is magic, as you will get stronger over time not weaker.
48.) Not having a strategy for recurring usage for customers as it much easier to acquire the same customer than a new one
49.) Not standardizing the work -Like what will a session offer for a customer
